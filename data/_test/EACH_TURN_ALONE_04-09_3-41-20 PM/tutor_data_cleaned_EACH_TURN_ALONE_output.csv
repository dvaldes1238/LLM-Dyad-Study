46,-1,1,45640,female,43.78234991142019,56.21765008857981,B: Hi.
46,1,NA,47484,female,24.508500210441888,75.49149978955812,"A: So, do you have like, a particular assignment, or like, a review?"
46,-1,1,52066,female,46.87906266262438,53.12093733737563,"B: Um, basically I had like, a list of concepts that I'm like, not really clear on that I would love to go over, I don't know if you have like a format.."
46,1,NA,57888,male,65.1354857898194,34.864514210180594,A: Okay great. Yea.
46,1,NA,61356,female,26.894143308897974,73.10585669110202,"A: No not u- usually it's like, people come in with their homework or whatever, but I'm happy to just like try to"
46,-1,1,65164,male,53.12093733737563,46.87906266262438,"B: Okay, I mean, I can also - I have an assignment that we can work on that is related to these things. But basically the stuff that I'd highlighted - and we can cover like as much or as little of this as is like necessary for tutoring, but I have abstract classes, immutability, interfaces, and exception handling."
46,1,NA,69822,male,77.72998508568418,22.270014914315837,A: Okay great.
46,1,NA,82028,male,65.13548782017745,34.86451217982255,"A: Got it, okay, got it. Um, so you're in Java. Okay, cool. I will do my best; I'm typically a Python tutor, but I took the class, so"
46,-1,1,85836,male,62.24593312018546,37.75406687981454,B: Yes.
46,-1,1,91678,male,53.12093733737563,46.87906266262438,"B: I mean, I took the Python class, like... I can review?"
46,1,NA,94336,female,40.733340004593025,59.266659995406975,"A: That's okay, it's okay, I'm not gonna, like, impart my, like knowledge. Alright so the first one was abstract classes? Oh God, okay, like, and the mutability?"
46,-1,1,100574,male,77.72998508568418,22.270014914315837,"B: Abstracted classes, yeah."
46,-1,1,104661,male,62.24593312018546,37.75406687981454,"B: Yeah, interfaces and exception handling, and if you'd prefer to zero in one on those we totally can."
46,1,NA,105794,male,67.91787056691699,32.082129433083026,A: Right
46,1,NA,109092,female,34.86451217982255,65.13548782017745,"A: Alright, alright. Mutability is just in terms of, like, like, different classes, and like, of, okay. Okay, okay. Let me think, I guess, and just jump in, um, or like do you have questions about any of them or do you just like need like, clarification? Okay, okay, for sure. Well, alright. Abstract classes I probably can't help you, like at all, like, I would need you to do it, like I forgot abstract classes. Um,mutability, in Java, I think like, a lot of thinks are mutable, like as opposed to Python. Like lists, obviously. Aren't strings mutable as well? I guess I shouldn't be asking you."
46,-1,1,114979,male,70.57850340255386,29.42149659744614,B: Yeah.
46,-1,1,126493,male,56.217650088579816,43.78234991142019,B: I need - those are the concepts that I just feel unclear on.
46,-1,1,139673,male,70.57850216484837,29.421497835151623,B: Okay.
46,1,NA,158324,male,65.13548782017745,34.86451217982255,"A: Um, okay. Exception handling, alright, exception handling, I mean I know, I know about that, alright. Sorry."
46,-1,1,165423,male,73.1058578630005,26.894142136999516,B: We can focus on that then.
46,1,NA,170088,female,46.87906266262437,53.12093733737563,"A: Um, so like in general, you'd wanna use like exception handling when you're doing something that you know is, like, likely to- likely to, like, cause errors, like, my m- oh yea, no please, please, um like, for me like file input and output, stuff like that, like any time I'm, like importing a file or something, like, you're likely to introduce a lot of errors because like, the file did not exist or something like that. So you would wanna do, like, exception handling"
46,-1,1,180290,female,24.508501313237172,75.49149868676282,B: Do you mind if I take notes
46,-1,1,186345,male,77.72998508568418,22.270014914315837,B: Yeah.
46,-1,1,197591,female,43.78234991142019,56.21765008857981,"B: Right, yeah. I guess part of what I'm confused about is like what situations would you like, be uncertain that like... I'm just confused about, I guess if you're anything with user input or anything where you're trying to access a file."
46,1,NA,208644,female,43.78234991142019,56.21765008857981,"A: Mhm. Yea, yea definitely big time because, yea user input is like, you never know what they're gonna put in, they can put in something that, like would crash your code if you didn't check for it, like if you were doing something specifically about, like integers, let's say, and you needed integer input, and then they gave, like, a string that could like, give a bunch of errors in your code because your whole code is written to, like, accommodate integers, so like that's a time when you would need exception handling because you never know what the user's gonna put in, you can never really trust the user, and then you have files that's like technically, like, for your homeworks and stuff, you're pretty much always gonna know where the file is and that it exists, but, like in general it's still good to code that in the exception handling because, like"
46,-1,1,225015,male,81.7574478416099,18.242552158390104,B: Yeah.

46,1,NA,252232,male,56.217650088579816,43.78234991142019,"A: Just, since you'r- you're going like outside the scope of your program, like you really only know what for sure is happening like, in what you're typing, and so since when you're doing file input output, or, like, when you're importing a file y- you never know, like that file could be corrupted, too, or something like that because you don't have, like, direct control over it so you would wanna, like, catch some kind of error or something like that."
46,-1,1,260894,male,73.10585844894972,26.894141551050293,B: Right.
46,-1,1,268860,male,79.81867777396211,20.181322226037885,B: Yeah.

46,-1,1,279043,female,10.669060388702057,89.33093961129795,"B: And then like. I guess I'm just like... I'm like super rusty on this so I should probably just like check my notes to be able to like even to ask the right questions. But just like, the logistics of like how to go about it I'm kind of also just like..."
46,1,NA,287762,male,67.91786991753929,32.0821300824607,"A: Okay it's perfect. Yea, whatever."

46,-1,1,302516,male,65.13548646660541,34.86451353339457,B: I guess I'm like... I'm confused about the difference between Java and Python.
46,1,NA,306700,male,77.72998508568418,22.270014914315837,A: Okay.
46,-1,1,308449,male,65.13548782017745,34.86451217982255,B: The like... try cache block and like having multiple cache statements.
46,1,NA,315574,male,56.21765008857981,43.78234991142019,A: Oh okay. Like how you can do that.
46,-1,1,319640,female,46.87906266262437,53.12093733737563,"B: How you can do that, and how you set that up."
46,1,NA,322714,male,85.19528019683105,14.804719803168947,"A: God. I definitely couldn't tell you off the top of my head how you set it up. yea, so sorry."
46,-1,1,332152,female,40.733340004593025,59.266659995406975,"B: Would it be easier, I mean, I have an assignment that I can work on.... I can work through it, yeah."

46,1,NA,342774,female,37.75406687981454,62.24593312018546,"A: It's not like the class is called intro to computer programming and intro to computer science, they're probably like, yea."

46,-1,1,717574,female,43.78234991142019,56.21765008857981,"B: Yeah, I can see how they're doing the try cache block here. Sort of... give an example of how that works?"
46,1,NA,722724,male,59.266659995406975,40.733340004593025,"A: Right, yea, right. That one's just a singular one, so that's like pretty straightforward. And he- they're- all they're doing is like an error message. Yea."
46,-1,1,727495,male,77.72998663336156,22.27001336663842,B: Yeah.
46,-1,1,732099,female,46.87906266262437,53.12093733737563,"B: I guess, part of what I'm confused about is, is this something that, is that just like a generic thing like 'file not found exception' or did they like, define what 'file not found' was."
46,1,NA,741560,male,53.12093733737563,46.87906266262438,"A: They didn't define it but like Java knows what that is, like this is a specifically, like they're looking for one kind of specific error that Java will throw which is when it can't find a file, it'll throw a file not found exception."
46,-1,1,744651,male,65.13548782017745,34.86451217982255,B: Java knows what that is?
46,-1,1,751778,male,53.12093733737563,46.87906266262437,"B: Right. So there's like, a list of types of exceptions that already exist in Java that, and those are what you put for the?"
46,1,NA,758186,male,53.12093733737563,46.87906266262438,"A: Yea exact- exactly. And like if you're actually coding, like and you do, like Ja- like Java won't let you just like try to import a file without having some kind of error catch, it'll like give you an error. So, like, hovering over like, file import or whatever it'll be like this, like, throws a file not found exception, so like, either like surround it in a try catch or do this other thing. Which is obviously not as helpful on like tests, but like, in terms of you actually coding, like, Java will like, it'll tell you which one of those."

Um, but, before, so, this comment, create the scanner to read the f- info from the file,so you've created the scanner, but we actually haven't read the data yet.

46,1,NA,984762,male,65.1354857898194,34.864514210180594,A: That's weird.
46,-1,1,986484,male,75.49149923816047,24.508500761839528,B: Yeah.
46,1,NA,987924,male,53.120937337375615,46.87906266262437,A: So how are you supposed to test your code?

46,1,NA,1019952,female,40.733340004593025,59.266659995406975,A: Right because what my mind is like telling me is that we would read through the input file and save all the information in like
46,1,NA,1027432,female,26.89414272294874,73.10585727705126,"A: A list or something like that, and then go through that list in order to write it onto the next file. Although, I suppose you can do it in one step like read it and then immediately write it onto your other file. The only thing is because Java's so picky it's like, has next is like specifically for strings and like has next int is specifically for ints or whatever. And so like I would b- I'm curious to know what like what information is held in that file and like what pattern of like ints and strings, or whatever, do you need to like read it with."
46,-1,1,1029102,male,75.49149923816047,24.508500761839528,B: Yeah.
46,-1,1,1033481,male,77.72998508568416,22.270014914315833,B: Yeah.
46,-1,1,1049256,male,75.49149923816047,24.508500761839528,B: Yeah.
46,-1,1,1058852,male,73.1058578630005,26.894142136999516,B: Right.
46,-1,1,1062205,male,56.21765008857981,43.78234991142019,B: I guess this is...
46,-1,1,1073018,male,56.21765008857981,43.78234991142019,B: I don't know if this is the exact data that's supposed to be there.
46,1,NA,1080234,male,67.91786991753929,32.0821300824607,A: Right it- like it's just a list of cities.
46,-1,1,1085511,male,67.91786926816161,32.08213073183839,B: City database.
46,1,NA,1087442,male,67.91787056691699,32.082129433083026,A: Okay
46,1,NA,1096384,male,73.10585844894972,26.894141551050293,A: Okay
46,1,NA,1098696,male,62.245933820551095,37.754066179448905,"A: Well, I mean the thing you would do for- to start reading it is w- like, you do like wall scanner dot has next. Does that ring a bell to you?"
46,-1,1,1108367,male,70.57850216484837,29.421497835151623,B: No.
46,1,NA,1109236,male,62.24593312018546,37.754066879814545,"A: Okay, okay. I can explain that. So like in Python when you would read files you'd just be like dot read and it would be like read it all and it's like here you go. Java's not so easy like that, Java you kind of read through as you go. And you read through by checking like what the next thing is, like what's the next thing I've seen. And so when you're reading something you're pretty much always gonna have to set it up in a loop because you're basically gonna keep asking your file like, ""Have I read everything?"" No ""Have I read everything?"" No ""Have I read everything?"" et cetera. And so the call the check like, ""Have I read everything?"" is like, dot has next, which is just like true if there's something else to read and false otherwise. So the loop that you set up all your file-reading in is generally like while whatever scanner dot has next. So it's going loop until it's literally read all of the information and then stopped."
46,-1,1,1110993,male,73.10585727705127,26.89414272294874,B: Yeah.
46,-1,1,1115721,male,79.81867801399694,20.181321986003056,B: Yeah.
46,-1,1,1118766,female,37.75406687981454,62.24593312018546,B: Right.
46,-1,1,1134206,male,73.1058584489497,26.894141551050293,B: Yeah.
46,-1,1,1154612,female,43.78234991142019,56.21765008857981,"B: Right. So is each iteration like, of the loop, like, is it like you can read one integer or one, like line? He hasn't really."
46,1,NA,1163704,male,73.10585727705126,26.89414272294874,"A: Yea there's- so you choose, so there's has next which just is like, is there any data that you haven't read at all, but to actually read the f- data, you do like a dot next, just next by itself is just like, read the next like string, and I'm guessing it's like string to a blank space. So if it were like dog space cat, and you were right before that, like the dot next would give you dog. And then, but if it were like one, two, three, four you can do dot, uh, next int, and that's gonna give you an int, and I bet there's ones for like, maybe doubles, or something like that, or floats, and then there's definitely also, like, dot next line, which would give you like the whole line at a time."
46,-1,1,1169213,male,73.10585727705127,26.89414272294874,B: Yeah.
46,-1,1,1186401,male,67.91786991753929,32.0821300824607,B: Yeah.
46,-1,1,1203100,male,75.49149813536518,24.508501864634823,"B: Yeah. So it's hard to do this not knowing like... but depending on what it is, would I just... so I set up a while loop?"
46,1,NA,1206170,male,70.57850216484837,29.421497835151623,"A: Right exactly, exactly."
46,1,NA,1211950,female,43.78234991142019,56.21765008857981,A: Yea th- and the while loop is always the same just dot has next while whatever ha- has next.
46,-1,1,1218051,male,83.54835432479662,16.451645675203384,B: Yeah.
46,1,NA,1220110,female,43.78234991142019,56.21765008857981,A: But in our case it's called in scanner.
46,-1,1,1224578,male,62.24593312018546,37.75406687981454,"B: Wait, so."
46,-1,1,1232125,female,43.78234991142019,56.21765008857981,B: How do I get it to actually read the data file?
46,1,NA,1235580,female,32.0821300824607,67.91786991753929,"A: So th- the while- your while, like, whatever it's called, isn't actually going to be doing the reading, that's what's gonna happen inside your loop. Like to get it to read som- saying like dot next is it reading like the next string."
46,-1,1,1243645,male,67.91787121629466,32.08212878370535,B: Okay.
46,-1,1,1249389,male,73.1058578630005,26.894142136999516,B: Right.
46,1,NA,1250030,female,46.87906266262438,53.12093733737563,A: For example
46,-1,1,1252158,male,62.245933820551095,37.754066179448905,B: So the condition is... sorry. While in scanner... dot has next.
46,1,NA,1253362,female,46.87906266262438,53.12093733737563,"A: N-n-n-no you're, you're totally fine."

46,1,NA,1280800,female,26.89414272294874,73.10585727705126,"A: Oh so what that's telling you is that it returns a Boolean 'cause it's gonna say true if it does have stuff left to read and false otherwise. But yea you don't have to put anything in those parentheses, you just do them empty."
46,-1,1,1286575,male,67.9178692681616,32.08213073183839,"B: Oh, yeah."
